- Alert escalation workflows

## Component Relationships

### Data Ingestion Layer

**Stream Processing Architecture**
```
Telemetry Sources → Message Queue → Stream Processors → Event Store
                                        ↓
                                   Real-time Analytics
                                        ↓
                                   Dashboard Updates
```

**Key Components**
- **Message Brokers**: Apache Kafka for high-throughput event streaming
- **Stream Processors**: Apache Flink for real-time analytics
- **Event Store**: EventStore or Apache Pulsar for event persistence
- **Schema Registry**: Confluent Schema Registry for data evolution

### AI Analysis Engine

**Model Serving Architecture**
```
Feature Store → Model Registry → Inference Service → Prediction Cache
     ↑               ↑                ↓                    ↓
Training Data   Model Versions   Real-time Scoring   Dashboard APIs
```

**Design Patterns**
- **Model Versioning**: A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- **Feature Store**: Centralized feature management and serving
- **Model Monitoring**: Performance tracking and drift detection
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple models for robust predictions

### Data Storage Strategy

**Polyglot Persistence Pattern**
- **Time Series DB**: InfluxDB for telemetry data
- **Document Store**: MongoDB for configuration and metadata
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for relationship analysis
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for real-time data access
- **Data Lake**: S3/MinIO for long-term storage and analytics

### API Design Patterns

**GraphQL Federation**
- Unified API gateway across microservices
- Type-safe schema composition
- Efficient data fetching with single requests
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

**REST API Patterns**
- Resource-based URLs with consistent naming
- HTTP status codes for proper error handling
- Pagination and filtering for large datasets
- Rate limiting and authentication middleware

## Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Security Model

**Authentication & Authorization**
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for service-to-service communication

**Data Protection**

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

**Auto-scaling Policies**

- Cache invalidation patterns for real-time data
- Precomputed aggregations for common queries
- Edge caching for global distribution

**Data Processing Optimization**
- Batch processing for historical analysis
- Stream processing for real-time insights
- Parallel processing with worker pools
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks

## Monitoring and Observability

### Three Pillars of Observability

**Metrics**
- Business metrics (lap times, predictions accuracy)
- System metrics (latency, throughput, error rates)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- Custom metrics for domain-specific insights

**Logging**
- Structured logging with consistent formats
- Centralized log aggregation with ELK stack
- Log correlation across distributed services
- Security and audit logging

**Tracing**
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Request flow visualization across services
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation analysis

### Alerting Strategy

**Alert Hierarchy**
- **Critical**: System down, data loss, safety alerts
- **Warning**: Performance degradation, capacity issues
- **Info**: Deployment notifications, scheduled maintenance

**Alert Routing**
- On-call rotation for critical alerts
- Escalation policies for unacknowledged alerts
- Integration with communication platforms (Slack, PagerDuty)
- Alert fatigue prevention with intelligent grouping

## Development Patterns

### DevOps and CI/CD

**GitOps Workflow**
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Application deployment with ArgoCD
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for scalability validation

### Code Organization

**Domain-Driven Design**
- Bounded contexts for different business domains
- Aggregate patterns for data consistency
- Domain events for cross-context communication
- Ubiquitous language across team and code

**Clean Architecture**
- Dependency inversion for testability
- Separation of concerns across layers
- Framework-independent business logic
- Adapter patterns for external integrations

This system architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for VitalCORE while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and integrations.
