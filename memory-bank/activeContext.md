# Active Context - VitalCORE

## Current Work Focus

### Project Initialization Phase
**Status**: Setting up foundational project structure and documentation
**Priority**: High - Establishing clear project foundation before development begins

### Immediate Objectives
1. **Memory Bank Completion**: Finalizing all core memory bank documentation
2. **Project Structure Setup**: Creating initial directory structure and configuration files
3. **Development Environment**: Setting up local development environment with Docker
4. **Initial Prototyping**: Beginning with core data ingestion and basic dashboard

## Recent Changes and Decisions

### Documentation Established
- **Project Brief**: Comprehensive project overview with clear objectives and timeline
- **Product Context**: Detailed problem analysis and user experience vision
- **System Patterns**: Event-driven microservices architecture with AI-first approach
- **Technical Context**: Modern tech stack with Python/FastAPI backend and React frontend

### Key Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Chosen for real-time processing and scalability requirements
2. **Polyglot Persistence**: Multiple databases optimized for different data types and access patterns
3. **AI-First Design**: Machine learning integrated at the core rather than as an afterthought
4. **Cloud-Native Approach**: Kubernetes-based deployment with multi-cloud strategy

### Technology Stack Finalized
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI, Apache Kafka for messaging
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Material-UI for components
- **Data**: PostgreSQL + InfluxDB + Redis for different data needs
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch with TorchServe for model serving
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Kubernetes with Terraform for IaC

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish progress.md documentation
2. **Project Structure**: Create initial directory structure with proper organization
3. **Development Environment**: Set up Docker Compose for local development
4. **Basic Configuration**: Create configuration files and environment setup
5. **README Documentation**: Create comprehensive project README

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Next 2-3 weeks)
1. **Data Models**: Define core data structures for telemetry and events
2. **API Foundation**: Create basic FastAPI application with health checks
3. **Database Setup**: Initialize PostgreSQL and InfluxDB schemas
4. **Message Queue**: Set up Kafka topics and basic producers/consumers
5. **Basic Frontend**: Create React application with routing and basic layout

### Phase 3: MVP Development (Following 4-6 weeks)
1. **Data Ingestion**: Implement telemetry data ingestion pipeline
2. **Real-time Processing**: Basic stream processing for live data
3. **Dashboard Core**: Essential dashboard components for data visualization
4. **API Endpoints**: Core REST endpoints for data access
5. **Authentication**: Basic user authentication and authorization

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions
1. **Development Approach**: Start with monolithic structure, evolve to microservices
2. **Data Ingestion Strategy**: Begin with REST API, add Kafka streaming later
3. **Frontend Architecture**: Component-based design with reusable telemetry widgets
4. **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage

### Open Questions Requiring Resolution
1. **Telemetry Data Format**: Need to define standard schema for different data sources
2. **Real-time Requirements**: Specific latency targets for different use cases
3. **User Authentication**: Integration with existing team management systems
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Development → Staging → Production pipeline details

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance Risks**: Early prototyping of high-throughput data processing
2. **Integration Complexity**: Phased approach starting with simulated data
3. **Scalability Concerns**: Design for scale from beginning, implement incrementally
4. **User Adoption**: Regular feedback cycles with target users during development

## Current Development Environment Status

### Local Setup Requirements
- **Docker Desktop**: Required for containerized development environment
- **VS Code**: Primary IDE with recommended extensions
- **Git**: Version control with GitFlow branching strategy
- **Node.js 18+**: For frontend development and tooling
- **Python 3.11+**: For backend development

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branches**: All development in feature branches from develop
2. **Code Review**: Pull requests required for all changes
3. **Testing**: Automated tests run on all commits
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant memory bank files with significant changes

## Integration Points and Dependencies

### External Dependencies
1. **Weather APIs**: Integration with weather services for environmental data
2. **Track Databases**: Access to track layout and configuration data
3. **Timing Systems**: Integration with existing race timing infrastructure
4. **Telemetry Hardware**: Support for various telemetry data formats

### Internal Dependencies
1. **Data Pipeline**: Stream processing depends on message queue setup
2. **Dashboard**: Frontend depends on API endpoints and real-time data
3. **AI Models**: Model serving depends on feature store and data pipeline
4. **Authentication**: All services depend on centralized auth service
